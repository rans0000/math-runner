Math Runner is a 3D game I'm building to learn game development with the Godot game engine. This is a simple game where the player jumps over obstacles while running along a road. The game is in prototype stage and currently only has jumping, obstacles and a few environment elements implemented. A basic implementation of scores for collecting coins and distanced traveled are also included with a split screen option to play with a friend.

You can find a basic prototype at [itch.io](https://fireashfire.itch.io/math-runner) or [gotm.io](https://gotm.io/fireashfire/math-runner). My ultimate aim is to create games exclusively using free and open-source technologies (FOSS) and this project is the first step in that journey.

This project is built using:
1. Godot 3.2.3 (game engine with GDScript)
2. Blender 2.8x (modelling, animation)
3. Krita 4.x & Gimp 2.x (Image editing, texturing)
4. Adobe XD (UI)
